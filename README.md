This project leverages data analytics tools to transform raw train ride data into actionable insights. We utilized **Python** for data cleaning, **Power Query** for both data modeling and cleaning, **SQL** for database modeling and querying, and **Tableau** for creating predictive visualizations and interactive dashboards.
