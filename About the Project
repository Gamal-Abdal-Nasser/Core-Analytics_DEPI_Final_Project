# 🚆 Railway Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **Core Analytics DEPI Final Project**, focusing on **railway data analysis** using **Python, Power Query, and Power BI**. The main goal is to clean, process, and model railway-related data to gain insights and improve operational efficiency.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **`railway.csv`** – Raw railway data
- **`railway_data_dictionary.csv`** – Description of dataset columns
- **`scripts/`** – Contains Python scripts for data cleaning
- **`power_query/`** – Power Query transformations
- **`power_bi/`** – Power BI modeling and dashboards
- **`README.md`** – Project documentation

## 🛠️ Workflow
### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning (Python)
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
- Standardize data formats
- Export cleaned data for further processing

### 2️⃣ Data Transformation (Power Query)
- Automate repetitive cleaning steps
- Prepare data for modeling

### 3️⃣ Data Modeling & Visualization (Power BI)
- Build a structured data model
- Create interactive dashboards and reports

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) – for data preprocessing
- **Power Query** – for ETL and transformations
- **Power BI** – for modeling and visualizations

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gamal-Abdal-Nasser/Core-Analytics_DEPI_Final_Project.git
   cd Core-Analytics_DEPI_Final_Project
   ```
2. Run the Python scripts to clean the data.
3. Load the cleaned data into Power Query for further processing.
4. Open the Power BI file to explore insights and dashboards.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Advanced predictive analytics using Machine Learning
- Integration with live railway data sources
- Optimized dashboard performance
